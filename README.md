Various observations about technology

Here I explore technology in its various forms.

I start with the MEAN stack on the Mac. See the paper in this repo.

Also, see the NEATWerx repo for a demo of the so-called NEAT stack (Node, Express, Angular, Tedious/T-SQL).

It is a variation on the MEAN stack that substitutes SQL Server for the database layer.
